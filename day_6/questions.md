## Day 5 Questions

1. In your own words, what is a Class?
A grammatical term for a type of object used as a 'parent' for subclasses and instance level objects.  The convention being you never have an 'instance' of a Class, i.e. classes do not have state.  A way to implement "do not repeat yourself".

1. In relation to a Class, what is an attribute?
Class-level scoped variables, that are (explicitly) passed 'up' scope.  Every 'instance' of a class will have these variables, but with different values.

1. In relation to a Class, what is behavior?
Class-level methods shared between all instances.

1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors

clase Doge
  attr_accessor :name, :is_a_good_boy

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
    @is_a_good_boy = true
  end
    
  def meme
    p "shitpost"
  end

  def a_good_boy
    p "
                   ▄              ▄

1. How do you create an instance of a class?
instance = class.new   use the '.new' Object method

1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?

Besides the added methods, is there anything at the fundamental level of ruby that makes a Class different than any other subset of Object?
