## Day 3 Questions
# OH.  These are Markdown

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
  if, elsif, else.  also unless.  ? is also a conditional!





1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
  This boils down to why computers EXIST.  The heart of a computer is the transistor, a physical if.  Everything the computer does is just recursive IF.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
  syntax:
  testifa ? iftruethenb : otherwisec
  if a then b else c end                 1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
  yeah, can't get them to work in IRB.  
  There's also another one line syntax 
  normal syntax is 
   if <test>
     code block
   elsif <test>
     code block
   else
     code block
   end

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?A
   guess I did this backwards.
   Anyway, just delete the elsif and else sections to get the if syntax.

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
   All the booleans
   Does matrix manipulation count as conditional?  Because I LOVE excel's SUMPRODUCT function SO hard.
   Does 'x' exist.  where x could be a method, class, file, object, etc.
